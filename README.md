# MobFightingSimulator
A text-based fighting simulation game where you go through rooms fighting Minecraft mobs


This is a very ambitious project that I want to do a lot with. Still need to learn more about Python as my main Language is Java and as similar as these languages are they have their differences.

Easy TODO:
- Add more mob types
- Differentiate mob accuracies
- Add more mob attacks
- Add final boss
- Add mini bosses
- Add drops
- Add armor
- Add uses

Complex TODO:
- Add inventory
- Improve accuracy choices
- Other worlds

Difficult TODO:
- Add machine learning
- Add AI
- Add deep learning
